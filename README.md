# Analysis-of-Longitudinal-Facebook-Posts-Before-and-After-a-Tornado-Using-Large-Language-Models
The tornado outbreak in the US in 2011 was one of the worst natural disasters in recent history. It left a big mark on communities and sparked a lot of conversation on social media. Based on Facebook posts made during the timeline of the disaster, this thesis presents a new dataset that shows the timeline and posts of public sentiment and behavioral at during this important event. The main goal is to look at how people's feelings and actions changed during the tornado outbreak. It will give us a full picture of how user opinion changes in real time. 
Large language models (LLMs) like GPT, BERT and twitter-sentiment-pl are used in the study, along with more advanced methods. I used topic modeling and hybrid mood analysis.
The study includes a comparison of LLMs, checking how well each model works on the brand-new dataset. I fine-tuned the LLMs from their basic model according to my database. So that it can predict more accurate sentiment of the Facebook posts. It shows a way to do sentiment analysis in real time so that we can use the technique to prepare a better and quicker disaster management system. This has important effects for emergency response plans and planning for real-time crisis communication.
